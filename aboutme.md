### About Me

My name is Ian, I'm from Vancouver, Canada (on the unceded territory of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations).

- BSc Hons., Health Studies and Gerontology, Waterloo (2007); MSc., Epidemiology, Queen's (2009); PhD, Population and Public Health, UBC (2019)
- Health Economist, [ARCC](https://cc-arcc.ca/) (2009-2020)
- Health Economics Manager, [CADTH](https://cadth.ca/) (2020-Present)

I got into health economics with the aim of safeguarding the long-term viability of the Canadian health care system. I got into R because I found Excel and TreeAge to be clunky (and expensive, in the case of the latter). I got into blogging about R because I found most of the guides were pretty unfriendly to novices.

Most of my coding knowledge was mentored by [Stavros Korokithakis of Stochastic Technologies](http://stochastic.io). If you're ever impressed with anything I've written, chances are that Stavros can take a huge chunk of the credit.

[I also play music sometimes](http://music.iancromwell.ca).

### About This Site

This blog is here to collect my random thoughts, ideas, and tinkerings as I develop R-based tools for doing things in health economics. I hope to eventually start describing my Python-based work as well.

The intended audience for this work is researchers, trainees, and others who are interested in cost-effectiveness model building but do not have a background in R or much coding experience at all. I will try to avoid jargon and give detailed explanations of what I'm doing.

Are you brand new to R? The best place to start is with my [Guide to Health State Transition Model Building in R](http://healthyuncertainty.github.io/RGuide/Introduction).

I built this site using [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) which was a super easy way to set it up (especially if you already have a GitHub). Rave reviews for making this process simple for me. Would definitely recommend.
