This blog is here to collect my random thoughts, ideas, and tinkerings as I develop R-based tools for doing things in health economics. I hope to eventually start describing my Python-based work as well.

The intended audience for this work is researchers, trainees, and others who are interested in cost-effectiveness model building but do not have a background in R or much coding experience at all. I will try to avoid jargon and give detailed explanations of what I'm doing.

The best place to start is with my Guide to Health State Transition Model Building in R.

### About Me

- BSc (Hons) Waterloo (2007), MSc Queen's (2009), PhD UBC (2019)
- Health Economist, BC Cancer (2009-2020)
- Health Economics Manager, CADTH (2020-Present)
- **Home**: Vancouver, BC, Canada

I got into health economics with the aim of safeguarding the long-term viability of the Canadian health care system. I got into R because I found Excel and TreeAge to be clunky (and expensive, in the case of the latter). I got into blogging about R because I found most of the guides were pretty unfriendly to novices.
