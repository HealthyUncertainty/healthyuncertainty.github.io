# Chapter 7 - Conclusion

I tried to write the guide that I wish I’d had when I was a Master’s student trying to program my first model. Most guides I’ve read don’t do a particularly good job of bridging the gap between theory and practice. I hope that this help make the prospect of building a model seem less intimidating.

I couldn’t have done this without some crucial help from [Dr. Karissa Johnston](https://www.mun.ca/pharmacy/about/karissajohnston.php), who taught me the basics of using R for this kind of work. [Stavros Korokithakis](https://www.stavros.io/) was a constant source of invaluable insight and offered many vital suggestions during the many times I got stuck. My colleagues at the [Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control](https://cc-arcc.ca/), particularly co-director [Dr. Stuart Peacock](https://www.sfu.ca/fhs/about/people/profiles/stuart-peacock.html), have also given me many years of support, encouragement, and feedback, and I want to thank them as well.

If you’ve found this guide helpful, or if there’s anything that you think is incorrect or confusing, please feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:healthyuncertainty@gmail.com) and/or [find me on Twitter](twitter.com/HlthyUncert). If you think the effort that went into this guide is worth a few bucks, you can e-transfer to that address, or I have [an online tip jar](http://paypal.me/localslounge) set up. Once again, if you end up publishing a model based on this code somewhere, I’d very much appreciate it if you’d let me know and throw my name into the acknowledgments section, but that’s a request; not a requirement.

Thanks for reading, and happy modeling!
